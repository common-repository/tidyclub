TidyClub plugin communicates with http://tidyclub.com, pulls in all of your scheduled events, and displays them either in a calendar or as posts.

== Description ==

TidyClub allows a club to display their upcoming events in a calendar format on their Wordpress website with the simple use of a shortcode; highlighting days on which events occur and linking to custom posts for each event. It also allows you to display all posts as though they were blog posts.

== Installation ==

1. You can download and install the Tidyclub plugin through the built-in Wordpress plugin installer. Alternately, download the zip file and upload the '/tidyclub/' folder to your '../wp-content/plugins/' folder.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the TidyClub menu page located beneath your Settings menu page. Follow the onscreen instructions.

Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: Is there a way to display multiple months at once? 

A: Not with this release. This is a feature that will come forth in future releases. 

Q: What is the short code that I need to use? 

A: The short code is listed on the TidyClub menu page after you enter your TidyClub username, password, and domain prefix. It is: [tidyclub_calendar]. 

== Screenshots ==

1. A quick shortcode, [tidyclub_calendar], allows you to display a calendar with the current month, and any day on which an event occurs will be highlighted and link to an event post with more details.
2. A custom options page allows you to quickly and easily change all the relevant colors of the calendar! We pride ourselves on the fact that all other CSS has been kept to a minimum - we want your calendar to match the rest of your site as much as possible!
3. We hope you enjoy the initial release of the plugin - we have grand and lofty plans to integrate fully with the http://tidyclub.com, and we are excited to continue developing this plugin out according to YOUR needs!
